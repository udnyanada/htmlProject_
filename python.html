          <p>Python is a general-purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.
            Python is an easy-to-learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.
            With its interpreted nature, Python's syntax and dynamic typing make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.
            Python supports multiple programming patterns, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.
